###Project Info

This project is a requirement of the FEND (FrontEnd NanoDegree) Program for [Udacity](www.udacity.com). In this project, we were tasked with creating test suites to test a feed reader application using the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) testing framework.

The goal is to learn the importance of testing and also how to implement this skill.

We were given a set of written expectations of the feed read app, and were tasked with writing the tests to actually test the given functionalities. The list can be found on the original project page [Udacity feed-reader](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
